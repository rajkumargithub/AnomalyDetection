# AnomalyDetection
This is simple python application of Anomaly Detection implementation by [nicolassmiller](https://github.com/Marcnuth/AnomalyDetection). And I have refered the sample implementation from [wdm0006](https://github.com/wdm0006/pyculiarity).

### Installation
```{bash}
pip install pyculiar
pip install -r requirements.txt
python AnomalyDetection.py
```
or
```{bash}
pythonw AnomalyDetection.py
``` 

This is a proof of concept implementation for reference.
